================

Upload files to your primary music library

-=========================- About Chrononizer Lite -=========================-

Chrononizer Lite is based off of Chrononizer v1.0.2. The goal of this project 
was to make an application that could be used on a computer which is using
a secondary music library. In this case, that computer is my laptop. With
Chrononizer Lite, the laptop can now send any new files it has in its library
to the primary music library, which in this case is the desktop.

Using this application, if I download a new song on my laptop, all I have to
do is put the new song in my laptop's music library. Then, once I am able to 
connect to my desktop over the network, I can use Chrononizer Lite to send
these new songs to my desktop's music library. Unlike Chrononizer,
Chrononizer Lite does not delete any old files -- it only copies new ones.

Like Chrononizer, Chrononizer Lite is intended for my own personal use.
However, I intend to keep it open source. If anyone else wants to build
something similar, they'll have the option of using my source code as a base.

If you wish to contact me about the application, or anything of the like,
feel free to send me an email at coolcord24@tutanota.com
